## Chapters

### 1. [Indigenous America](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/01-the-new-world)

- def NA: Native American

#### Intro

- Humans lived in the Americas > 10,000 years
- Hundreds of languages and thousands of cultures were created in Americas
- NAs built settled communities & migrated seasonally, deved vast trade nets
- Kinship tied communities together
- `Columbian Exchange`: exchange of people, animals, plants, microbes across the Atlantic
  - Caused disease to devastate the NA pop.; started centuries of violence

#### First Americans

- Written and oral traditions were passed down; sharing creation and migration histories
  - Salinan people (in CA): creation myth is of a bald eagle transforming the first man out of clay and the first woman out of a feather.
  - Lenape: creation myth tells of Sky Woman fell onto the world and onto a turtle's back with the help of a muskrat and beaver; creating turtle island (North America).
  - Choctaw: southeastern peoples' beginnings are inside of the great Mother Mound earthwork, Nunih Waya in the Mississippi Valley.
  - Nahua: started from the place of the Seven Caves where their ancestors emerged before migrating to central Mexico.
- The last global ice age allowed people to migrate from Asia to North america accross the Bering strait (12k - 14k years ago)
  - Native ancestors were hunter-gatherers which utilized the resources in the Beringian tundra on the NW edge of NA
    - Paused for 1.5k years
- Others crossed the seas and traveled along the Pacific coast
  - Glacial sheets receded (14k years ago) creating a more pleasant habitat southward and eastward; some peoples ventured down to SA
    - Traces of human activity started > 14.5k years ago in Chile and Florida
- Life styles
  - Northwestern native groups exploited salmon populations
  - On plains and prairie lands: hunt bison and move along seasonal patterns
- Agriculture developed around 9k and 5k years ago
  - Mesoamericans relied on domesticated maize, developing a settled population c. 1200 BCE
  - Corn & other crops spread throughout the region and became of spiritual importance
- The Eastern Woodlands: A fertile region between the Mississippi and the Atlantic Ocean
  - Planted the three sisters (corn, beans, and squash) as main source of food
  - The NA societies lived in small, dispersed communities to take adv of rich soils & plentiful rivers & streams
  - Native communities burned underbrush to clear land for the Three Sisters and for a good hunting ground
    - This is a cycle: clear underbrush --> grow the Three Sisters; when crop yields decrease --> move to some other land and clear it (extremely useful in difficult soil)
    - Crops can be continuously grown in one area in some fertile areas in the Eastern Woodlands
      - There farmers engaged in permanent intensive agriculture using hand tools
  - Women typically practiced agriculture while men hunted and fished
  - Agriculture led to a decline in health (weaker bones & teeth)
    - Still allows farmers to produce more food; allowing members to specialize (e.g. soldiers, religious leaders, artists)

Diff. between indigenous peoples and Europeans:

- NAs did not distinguish between natural & supernatural (spiritual power was tangible & readily accessible, could be harnessed)
- Kinship bound most NA people together (many lived in kinship networks)
- Ancestry was matrilineal (family and clan id followed mothers and daughters, not fathers and sons)
- Mothers often had a great amount of power & men's ids were associated with their relationships to women
- Women had more marital freedom (could choose husbands & divorce was easy)
- Ownership was not permanent (land was possessed when in active use by someone; still spent lots of energy to gain ownership over some land/resource)

NAs had many ways of communicating; e.g. graphical ones

- Algoquian-speaking Ojibwes use birch-bark scrolls to record medical treatments, recipes, songs, stores
- Some wove plant fibers, embroidered skins w/ porcupine quills, & modeled earth to make ceremonial sites
- Pacific Northwest weavers wove goat hairs into textiles with specific paterns
- Maya, Zapotec & Nahua ancestors painted history on plant made textiles/carved it into stone
- Plains peoples wove buffalo pair/painted on buffalo skin
- Inca recorders recorded info on khipu (knotted strings)

NA slavery are not based on holding people as property; they were considered as people who lack kinship nets --> slaves could become fully integrated through adoption/marriage

- Capturing & trading slaves was an important way NA communities grew/gained power

2k years ago the largest culture group were: the Puebloan groups in the Greater Southwest (SW US & NW Mexico); the Mississippian groups along the Great River & tributaries; the Mesoamerican groups in Mexico and the Yucatán

- Dev in agri tech enabled explosive growth in early societies; e.g. Tenochtitlán in Mexico, Cahokia along the Mississippi, desert oasis areas in the Greater SW

Puebloan peoples:

- Chaco Canyon in N New Mexico was home to these peoples between 900 and 1300 CE; ~1.5k people lived in the canyon
- Sophisticated agri, extensive trading nets, domestication of animals like turkeys --> pop. swell
- Lived in huge resid structs made of sandstone blocks & lumber
- Pueblo Bonito was a huge structure with hundreds of rooms and many stories and were decorated with objects brought through the large trading networks
- Kiva: small dugouts in homes like Pueblo Bonito; important ceremonial center for Puebloan life
- Spirituality was tied to the earth and heavens; generations charted stars & made homes in line with the path of the sun & moon
- The puebloan people of Chaco canyon faced many challenges: deforestation, overirrigation, drought --> caused a collapse & people to disperse into smaller settlements.
  - New groups, e.g. the Apache and Navajo entered & adopted Puebloan customs

Mississippians:

- Deved the one of the largest civs N of Mexico
- Cahokia: largest settlement of Misses; peaked in pop ~10k-30k (rivaling contemporary Euro cities in size)
  - Politically org around chiefdoms (hierarchial clan-based sys that gives leaders secular and religious auth); probably on many smaller chiefdoms under a paramount leader
  - Key trading center bc of it's near the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri
    - The rivers created a huge trading network stretching from the Great lakes to the NA SE
    - Some sea shells were transported thousands of miles to get in this city
  - Preserved social stratification through freq wars
    - War captives were enslaved & imp part of econ of NA SE
  - Experienced "big bang": sea change in the political, social, & ideological fields; 1050
    - Pop grow 500% in a gen (people groups were absorbed into the city)
  - Collapsed by 1300: probably because of mounting warfare/political tensions
    - Less of an overburdening of arable land; depopulation through emigration; deforestation, erosion, & drought
- Mons Mound: large hill that rose ten stories; center of Cahokia
- Life and death were linked w/ the movement of celestial bodies & ceremonial earthwork structs reflect these forces
- NA communities were connected by kin, politics, & sustained by long-dist trading routes
  - Waterways were crucial for transport and comm, w/ the Mississippi as an important trade artery

Lenapes (AKA Delawares):

- Farmed the bottomlands throughout the Hudson & Deleware watersheds in the Eastern Woodlands
  - Takes adv of fertile soil & lots of waterways
- Their hundreds of settlements were loosely connected by political, social and spiritual connections
  - Many are relatively independent but are connected w/ oral histories, ceremonial traditions, consensus-based political organization, & shared clan sys
  - Marriage occurred between clans & married men joined the clan of his wife
- Women had auth over marriages, households, agr, & leader selections
- Sachems: leaders in Lenape communities
  - Gained power through demonstrating wisdom & experience by the consent of their people
- Dispersed auth, small settlements, kin-based org contrib to the stability and resilience of Lenape communities
  - Good farming and fishing practices enhanced their stability
    - Planted tobacco, sunflowers, medicinal plants, & gourds + the 3 Sis; harvested fruits, nuts
    - Gathered in large groups to effectively farm during planting and harvesting; org seasonal fish camps to catch shellfish & shad; wove nets, baskets from rushes; made homes in fertile lands
- Large gatherings formed for ceremonial purposes/make big decisions
  - Councils included men, women, and elders; Sachems spoke for their people
- Did not engage in large-scale war

Pacific Northwest groups: Kwakwka'wakw, Tlingits, Haidas, ...

- The groups thrived in a land of moderate climate, lush forests, & many rivers
  - People in this region depended on salmon for survival & valued it heavily
    - Salmon decorated totem poles, baskets, & other tools
    - Salmon represented prosperity, life, & renewal
- Utilized sustainable fishing practices to ensure the survival of salmon pops
  - Many groups practiced the First Salmon Ceremony when salmon is first spotted each season
    - Elders observed the size of salmon & delayed harvesting to ensure enough survived to spawn
  - Commonly used nets, hooks, & other tools to catch salmon
- Huge cedar canoes enabled fishing expeditions in the Pacific Ocean
  - Fishermen caught halibut, sturgeon, & other fish
- Food surplus enabled large population growth
  - Pacific NW became one of the most densely pop regions of NA
- Social org centered on elaborate feasts called `potlatches`
  - Potlatches celebrated births, weddings & determined social stat.
    - Parties lasted for days & hosts demo their wealth & power by entertaining guests w/ food, art, & performances
  - The more given away, the more prestige & power they get in a group
    - Some men saved for decades to host great potlatches which would gain them power in the group
- Many people in the Pacific NW built elaborate plank houses out of the regions cedar trees
  - The Suquamish Oleman house (Old Man House): rested on the banks of Puget Sound
  - Trees were also carved & painted in the shape of animals/other figures to tell stories
    - Totem poles became the most recog artistic form in the Pacific NW
    - People also created masks & other wooden items; e.g. hand drums & rattles

#### European Expansion

Before Columbus

- Scandinavian seafarers reached the New World c. 1000 CE
  - Leif Erikson reached Newfoundland in Canada
    - Failed to create a colony; caused by a combo of limited resources, bad weather, food shortages, & native resistance
  - The sailed as far as Constantinople & raided settlements in North Africa; est colonies in Iceland and Greenland  

_Before discovering the new world:_

- The Crusades linked Europe with Asia, rediscovering/adopting Greek, Roman, & Muslim knowledge --> sparked the Renaissance & fueled Euro expansion
- European nation-states were consolidated under the auth of kings
- Many military conflicts between Eng and Fr -- Hundred Years' War -- accel nationalism & created financial & military administration to maintain nation-states
- Marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon & Isabella of Castile consolidated the most powerful kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula --> The Reconquista succeeded (expelled Muslim Moors & Iberian Jews in 1492)
- Italian traders controlled the Mediterranean trading path to Asia; Spain & Portugal relied on them for Asian goods and paid higher prices for them; sought a new way to Asia
- Portugal heavily invested in exploration; Prince Henry **the Navigator** invested in research & created many breakthroughs (Perfected the astrolabe, & the caravel)
- Portuguese est forts along the Atlantic coast of Africa in 1400s; starting cens of Euro colon
- Portuguese trading posts gened new profits & spread across the coastline of Africa
- Vasco de Gama traveled aroudn the coasts of Africa to reach Asia
- Limits of tech forced Iberian sailors to sail west before cutting back east to Africa --> Spanish and Portuguese found several coasts of the coast of Europe & Africa (e.g. Azores, the Canary, Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, ...)
- Sugar was a popular, profitable luxury item in Euro but originally grown in Asia
  - Sugar was a difficult crop & cannot be grown anywhere in great scale in Euro
- The Portuguese started growing it in the Islands of the Atlantic & used natives and African slaves in to plant and harvest the labor intensive sugar cane
  - Traded with powerful African kingdoms they just gained access to (Kongo, Ndongo, Songhai) for slaves in exchange for guns, iron & manufactured goods
- Spain also wanted to create an empire so they allowed Columbus (a skilled Italian-born sailor who had studied under Portuguese navigators) to create an opp for them

After discovery of the new world

- Columbus sailed w/ 3 small ships (Ni;a, Pinta, Santa Mar[ia) and ninety men landed in the Bahamas (part of the West Indies)
- Columbus described the tribes as kind people but left sailors to seek gold and captured some slaves and presented them to the Spanish crown
  - Received approval to head a return journey to subjugate the NA peoples and seek wealth
- The Spanish quickly exhausted the gold reserves on the West Indies & forced the NA pop into forced labor under the encomienda sys
  - Spanish presumed the NAs didn't have humanity & used brutal methods to extract wealth from the West Indies
  - The NA pop was nearly wiped out in a gen; 1+ mil people gone because of diseases & warfare
