Notes on the [American YAWP textbook](https://www.americanyawp.com)

## Chapters

### 1. [Indigenous America](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/01-the-new-world)

- def NA: Native American

#### Intro

- Humans lived in the Americas > 10,000 years
- Hundreds of languages and thousands of cultures were created in Americas
- NAs built settled communities & migrated seasonally, deved vast trade nets
- Kinship tied communities together
- `Columbian Exchange`: exchange of people, animals, plants, microbes across the Atlantic
  - Caused disease to devastate the NA pop.; started centuries of violence

#### First Americans

- Written and oral traditions were passed down; sharing creation and migration histories
  - Salinan people (in CA): creation myth is of a bald eagle transforming the first man out of clay and the first woman out of a feather.
  - Lenape: creation myth tells of Sky Woman fell onto the world and onto a turtle's back with the help of a muskrat and beaver; creating turtle island (North America).
  - Choctaw: southeastern peoples' beginnings are inside of the great Mother Mound earthwork, Nunih Waya in the Mississippi Valley.
  - Nahua: started from the place of the Seven Caves where their ancestors emerged before migrating to central Mexico.
- The last global ice age allowed people to migrate from Asia to North america accross the Bering strait (12k - 14k years ago)
  - Native ancestors were hunter-gatherers which utilized the resources in the Beringian tundra on the NW edge of NA
    - Paused for 1.5k years
- Others crossed the seas and traveled along the Pacific coast
  - Glacial sheets receded (14k years ago) creating a more pleasant habitat southward and eastward; some peoples ventured down to SA
    - Traces of human activity started > 14.5k years ago in Chile and Florida
- Life styles
  - Northwestern native groups exploited salmon populations
  - On plains and prairie lands: hunt bison and move along seasonal patterns
- Agriculture developed around 9k and 5k years ago
  - Mesoamericans relied on domesticated maize, developing a settled population c. 1200 BCE
  - Corn & other crops spread throughout the region and became of spiritual importance
- The Eastern Woodlands: A fertile region between the Mississippi and the Atlantic Ocean
  - Planted the three sisters (corn, beans, and squash) as main source of food
  - The NA societies lived in small, dispersed communities to take adv of rich soils & plentiful rivers & streams
  - Native communities burned underbrush to clear land for the Three Sisters and for a good hunting ground
    - This is a cycle: clear underbrush --> grow the Three Sisters; when crop yields decrease --> move to some other land and clear it (extremely useful in difficult soil)
    - Crops can be continuously grown in one area in some fertile areas in the Eastern Woodlands
      - There farmers engaged in permanent intensive agriculture using hand tools
  - Women typically practiced agriculture while men hunted and fished
  - Agriculture led to a decline in health (weaker bones & teeth)
    - Still allows farmers to produce more food; allowing members to specialize (e.g. soldiers, religious leaders, artists)

Diff. between indigenous peoples and Europeans:

- NAs did not distinguish between natural & supernatural (spiritual power was tangible & readily accessible, could be harnessed)
- Kinship bound most NA people together (many lived in kinship networks)
- Ancestry was matrilineal (family and clan id followed mothers and daughters, not fathers and sons)
- Mothers often had a great amount of power & men's ids were associated with their relationships to women
- Women had more marital freedom (could choose husbands & divorce was easy)
- Ownership was not permanent (land was possessed when in active use by someone; still spent lots of energy to gain ownership over some land/resource)

NAs had many ways of communicating; e.g. graphical ones

- Algoquian-speaking Ojibwes use birch-bark scrolls to record medical treatments, recipes, songs, stores
- Some wove plant fibers, embroidered skins w/ porcupine quills, & modeled earth to make ceremonial sites
- Pacific Northwest weavers wove goat hairs into textiles with specific paterns
- Maya, Zapotec & Nahua ancestors painted history on plant made textiles/carved it into stone
- Plains peoples wove buffalo pair/painted on buffalo skin
- Inca recorders recorded info on khipu (knotted strings)

NA slavery are not based on holding people as property; they were considered as people who lack kinship nets --> slaves could become fully integrated through adoption/marriage

- Capturing & trading slaves was an important way NA communities grew/gained power

2k years ago the largest culture group were: the Puebloan groups in the Greater Southwest (SW US & NW Mexico); the Mississippian groups along the Great River & tributaries; the Mesoamerican groups in Mexico and the Yucatán

- Dev in agri tech enabled explosive growth in early societies; e.g. Tenochtitlán in Mexico, Cahokia along the Mississippi, desert oasis areas in the Greater SW

Puebloan peoples:

- Chaco Canyon in N New Mexico was home to these peoples between 900 and 1300 CE; ~1.5k people lived in the canyon
- Sophisticated agri, extensive trading nets, domestication of animals like turkeys --> pop. swell
- Lived in huge resid structs made of sandstone blocks & lumber
- Pueblo Bonito was a huge structure with hundreds of rooms and many stories and were decorated with objects brought through the large trading networks
- Kiva: small dugouts in homes like Pueblo Bonito; important ceremonial center for Puebloan life
- Spirituality was tied to the earth and heavens; generations charted stars & made homes in line with the path of the sun & moon
- The puebloan people of Chaco canyon faced many challenges: deforestation, overirrigation, drought --> caused a collapse & people to disperse into smaller settlements.
  - New groups, e.g. the Apache and Navajo entered & adopted Puebloan customs

Mississippians:

- Deved the one of the largest civs N of Mexico
- Cahokia: largest settlement of Misses; peaked in pop ~10k-30k (rivaling contemporary Euro cities in size)
  - Politically org around chiefdoms (hierarchial clan-based sys that gives leaders secular and religious auth); probably on many smaller chiefdoms under a paramount leader
  - Key trading center bc of it's near the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri
    - The rivers created a huge trading network stretching from the Great lakes to the NA SE
    - Some sea shells were transported thousands of miles to get in this city
  - Preserved social stratification through freq wars
    - War captives were enslaved & imp part of econ of NA SE
  - Experienced "big bang": sea change in the political, social, & ideological fields; 1050
    - Pop grow 500% in a gen (people groups were absorbed into the city)
  - Collapsed by 1300: probably because of mounting warfare/political tensions
    - Less of an overburdening of arable land; depopulation through emigration; deforestation, erosion, & drought
- Mons Mound: large hill that rose ten stories; center of Cahokia
- Life and death were linked w/ the movement of celestial bodies & ceremonial earthwork structs reflect these forces
- NA communities were connected by kin, politics, & sustained by long-dist trading routes
  - Waterways were crucial for transport and comm, w/ the Mississippi as an important trade artery

Lenapes (AKA Delawares):

- Farmed the bottomlands throughout the Hudson & Deleware watersheds in the Eastern Woodlands
  - Takes adv of fertile soil & lots of waterways
- Their hundreds of settlements were loosely connected by political, social and spiritual connections
  - Many are relatively independent but are connected w/ oral histories, ceremonial traditions, consensus-based political organization, & shared clan sys
  - Marriage occurred between clans & married men joined the clan of his wife
- Women had auth over marriages, households, agr, & leader selections
- Sachems: leaders in Lenape communities
  - Gained power through demonstrating wisdom & experience by the consent of their people
- Dispersed auth, small settlements, kin-based org contrib to the stability and resilience of Lenape communities
  - Good farming and fishing practices enhanced their stability
    - Planted tobacco, sunflowers, medicinal plants, & gourds + the 3 Sis; harvested fruits, nuts
    - Gathered in large groups to effectively farm during planting and harvesting; org seasonal fish camps to catch shellfish & shad; wove nets, baskets from rushes; made homes in fertile lands
- Large gatherings formed for ceremonial purposes/make big decisions
  - Councils included men, women, and elders; Sachems spoke for their people
- Did not engage in large-scale war

Pacific Northwest groups: Kwakwka'wakw, Tlingits, Haidas, ...

- The groups thrived in a land of moderate climate, lush forests, & many rivers
  - People in this region depended on salmon for survival & valued it heavily
    - Salmon decorated totem poles, baskets, & other tools
    - Salmon represented prosperity, life, & renewal
- Utilized sustainable fishing practices to ensure the survival of salmon pops
  - Many groups practiced the First Salmon Ceremony when salmon is first spotted each season
    - Elders observed the size of salmon & delayed harvesting to ensure enough survived to spawn
  - Commonly used nets, hooks, & other tools to catch salmon
- Huge cedar canoes enabled fishing expeditions in the Pacific Ocean
  - Fishermen caught halibut, sturgeon, & other fish
- Food surplus enabled large population growth
  - Pacific NW became one of the most densely pop regions of NA
- Social org centered on elaborate feasts called `potlatches`
  - Potlatches celebrated births, weddings & determined social stat.
    - Parties lasted for days & hosts demo their wealth & power by entertaining guests w/ food, art, & performances
  - The more given away, the more prestige & power they get in a group
    - Some men saved for decades to host great potlatches which would gain them power in the group
- Many people in the Pacific NW built elaborate plank houses out of the regions cedar trees
  - The Suquamish Oleman house (Old Man House): rested on the banks of Puget Sound
  - Trees were also carved & painted in the shape of animals/other figures to tell stories
    - Totem poles became the most recog artistic form in the Pacific NW
    - People also created masks & other wooden items; e.g. hand drums & rattles

#### European Expansion

Before Columbus

- Scandinavian seafarers reached the New World c. 1000 CE
  - Leif Erikson reached Newfoundland in Canada
    - Failed to create a colony; caused by a combo of limited resources, bad weather, food shortages, & native resistance
  - The sailed as far as Constantinople & raided settlements in North Africa; est colonies in Iceland and Greenland  

_Before discovering the new world:_

- The Crusades linked Europe with Asia, rediscovering/adopting Greek, Roman, & Muslim knowledge --> sparked the Renaissance & fueled Euro expansion
- European nation-states were consolidated under the auth of kings
- Many military conflicts between Eng and Fr -- Hundred Years' War -- accel nationalism & created financial & military administration to maintain nation-states
- Marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon & Isabella of Castile consolidated the most powerful kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula --> The Reconquista succeeded (expelled Muslim Moors & Iberian Jews in 1492)
- Italian traders controlled the Mediterranean trading path to Asia; Spain & Portugal relied on them for Asian goods and paid higher prices for them; sought a new way to Asia
- Portugal heavily invested in exploration; Prince Henry **the Navigator** invested in research & created many breakthroughs (Perfected the astrolabe, & the caravel)
- Portuguese est forts along the Atlantic coast of Africa in 1400s; starting cens of Euro colon
- Portuguese trading posts gened new profits & spread across the coastline of Africa
- Vasco de Gama traveled aroudn the coasts of Africa to reach Asia
- Limits of tech forced Iberian sailors to sail west before cutting back east to Africa --> Spanish and Portuguese found several coasts of the coast of Europe & Africa (e.g. Azores, the Canary, Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, ...)
- Sugar was a popular, profitable luxury item in Euro but originally grown in Asia
  - Sugar was a difficult crop & cannot be grown anywhere in great scale in Euro
- The Portuguese started growing it in the Islands of the Atlantic & used natives and African slaves in to plant and harvest the labor intensive sugar cane
  - Traded with powerful African kingdoms they just gained access to (Kongo, Ndongo, Songhai) for slaves in exchange for guns, iron & manufactured goods
- Spain also wanted to create an empire so they allowed Columbus (a skilled Italian-born sailor who had studied under Portuguese navigators) to create an opp for them

After discovery of the new world

- Columbus sailed w/ 3 small ships (Ni;a, Pinta, Santa Mar[ia) and ninety men landed in the Bahamas (part of the West Indies)
- Columbus described the tribes as kind people but left sailors to seek gold and captured some slaves and presented them to the Spanish crown
  - Received approval to head a return journey to subjugate the NA peoples and seek wealth
- The Spanish quickly exhausted the gold reserves on the West Indies & forced the NA pop into forced labor under the encomienda sys
  - Spanish presumed the NAs didn't have humanity & used brutal methods to extract wealth from the West Indies
  - The NA pop was nearly wiped out in a gen; 1+ mil people gone because of diseases & warfare

#### Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Motives: land, gold, titles

- More and more people started to join in the conquest of the new world
- Used _encomienda_: each person who settled in the new world land and a number of natives
- Bartolomé de Las Casas: published report on the brutality of Spanish conquest
  - Switched to using the _repartimiento_: milder, but perpetuated the exploitation of the Native pop
- Hernán Cortés: Conquistador

Maya civ

- Massive temples, large pops, written language, math, good calendars
- Fell before the discovery of the new world; droughts and unsustainable agricultural practices

Aztecs

- Militaristic migrants from northern Mexico; conquered to dominance
- Created largest civ in the New World
- Tenochitlán: capital city, lots of people, built on _chinampas_ (artificial islands)
- Used decentralized net of peoples that paid tribute
  - Corn, beans; jade, cacao, gold; provided troops

- Hernán Cortés: Conquistador, invaded Mexico; relied on Native translator Doña Marina
- The Aztecs had a very fragile control over their empire --> many people groups betrayed them
- Cortés peacefully entered Tenochitlán and captured the emperor
  - Used the emperor to control the Aztec's resources (bullion, trade net)
- Aztecs revolted: Montezuma (emperor) was called a traitor --> killed w/ many of Cortés' men
- Cortés sieged Tenochitlán: cut of water, disease spread like wild fire
  - The million strong empire fell bc of disease, dissension, & a thousand conquistadors

Incas (Quechuas)

- Large mountain empire in the Andes
  - Cut terraces into the mountains to farm
- Open to attack bc the conquered peoples wanted to be free
- Small pox spread before the conquistadors, killed members of the royal family (including the emperor Huayna Capac)
- Francisco Pizarro: took the capital of the Incan empire
- New admin struct: royal appointees controlled large swaths of land; controlled the extraction of gold and silver & their transport across the Atlantic w/ Spanish galleons

Admin

- Migrants flooded into the New World; (3/4 million during Spanish control)
  - Migrants were mostly young, single men --> married there, incorporating NAs into colonial life
- Tolerated/supported interracial marrage; Mestizos made up most of colonial population
- Sistema de Castas (Casta system): organized racial groups based on "purity of blood"
  - prereqs for social and political advancement
    - Peninsulares: Spaniards born in Spain
    - Criollos: Spaniards born in the New World
    - Mestizo: of Spanish and Indian heritage
      - Middling social class; could advance if they hand money or married Spaniards
    - Some who could pass as being more Spanish would try using this to game the system
- Culture was a hybrid between Spaniards and Indians; much more of a mix than in the British colonies
  - e.g. Juan Diego reported seeing the Virgin Mary --> the Virgen de Guadalupe become a national icon for mestizo society
- Started expanding north, searching for gold and another Tenochitlán
  - Juan Ponce de León, conqueror or Puerto Rico, landed in Florida in search for wealth
  - Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca joined in the expedition to Florida; shipwrecked, made an odyssey to Mexico
  - Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565
- North America didn't offer that much wealth to the Spanish, but expeditions continued; the Spanish had wide scale control over much of America

### 2. [Colliding Cultures](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/02-colliding-cultures)

    - The Apalachee were some of the most powerful tribes in Florida
      - Used the Camino Real (The royal road), connecting the western part of the mission sys w/ St. Augustine
      - Grew lots of corn & other stuff
    - Spanish drove cattle east across St. Johns River & est. ranches close to the Apalachee
  - Santa Fe: first Euro settlement in the SW (est. 1610)
    - only few went (dry and hostile env) --> never commanded the region
      - By 1680: ~3k colonists
    - Traded w/ & exploited Puebloan peoples (pop dropped from 60k to 17k)
  - Spain then focused on using missions to expand (most in Franciscan order); 17th cen, firars est. many missions along the Rio Grande & in CA

#### Spain's Rivals

- England and France (the two powers which could compete w/ Spain) were thrown into turmoil w/ long conflicts and the reformation
  - Millions died from religious violence in France
- Reports of Spanish atrocities spread throughout Euro and provided justification for other conquests
  - Black legend: the Spanish accused critics of painting their legacy black
    - The Spanish had sig influence in many Euro nations due to conquest --> in bad terms w/ many other nations
- Dominated the New World
  - Much more wealth came from exploiting the Aztec & Incas
  - Eventually upset when the the Spanish Armada was destroyed & the English started to rule the waves

The French

- Subsidized exploration in early 16th cen
- Sought the Northwest Passage: waterway connecting North America with Asia
  - St. Lawrence River in Canada seemed like it
- French control centered on the Great Lakes
- Colonization dev through investment from private trading companies
  - Aimed to capture the fur trading market rather than take control of new territory
- Few Frenchmen traveled to settle & few to settle permanently in the New World
  - Many French Protestants (Huguenots) tried emigrating after France criminalized Protestantism (1685), but all non-Catholics were forbidden from emigrating
- French colonization fostered more cooperative & mutually beneficial relationships w/ Native Americans than was typical for the Spanish & English
- Jesuit missionaries moved in w/ the Native Americans to convert them (Franciscans usually brought NAs to camps)
- Métis(sage): Children w/ French father and Indian mother
- Huron peoples deved a close relationship w/ the French --> many converted to Christianity & many died due to Euro diseases and frequent combat w/ the Dutch
- Pressure from the Iroquois in the East pushed Algonquian-speaking peoples toward French territory (mid 17th) --> syncretism between the NAs and French
  - Frenchmen learned the gift giving & meditation customs of NA leaders
  - NAs learned to follow euro laws & euro markets
- The Great Lakes ("middle ground") had tumultuous success between the late 17th and early 18th (until American settlers swarmed the region)

The Dutch

  - Radical Protestants, Catholics, Jews were welcomed
  - The Pilgrims first fled to the Dutch before sailing to the New World
- Built empire through the work of merchants & sailors
- Most adv capitalists in the modern world; marshaled lots of resources by creating innovative finacial orgs (e.g. Amsterdam Stock Exchange & East India Company)
- The Dutch offered little democracy: power stayed in the hands of a few
- Dutch liberties had limits: The Dutch adv the slave trade (brought slaves w/ them to the New World), slavery was an essential part of Dutch capitalism
- The Dutch commissioned Henry Hudson (Englishman) to discover the NW passage; foudn the Hudson & claimed New York for the Ducth
  - Est. New Netherland there; quentassential part of the Dutch new world empire
  - Chartered the Dutch West India Company in 1621: est colonies in Africa, Caribbean, North America
  - Manhatten became an important launching pad to support Caribbean colonies & attack the Spanish
- Created guidelines for the New Netherland whcih conformed to the ideas of Hugo Frotius (legal philosopher who believed NAs had the same natural rights as europeans)
  - 1626: Peter Minuit "bought" Manhattan from Munsee Indians
    - The Dutch paid the wrong Indians --> Dutch were trying to be peaceful but they didn't think about land the way the Indians did
- Sought profit, not conquering
  - Traded wampum (ceremonial & diplomatic commodity among the Iroquois & made by the Algonquian Indians) for beaver pelts
    - Wampum became a currency
- Est farms, settlements, lumber camps
- Patroon sys (implemented by the West India Company): granted large estates to wealthy landlords who then paid for passage of tenants to work on their lands
  - Expanding Dutch settlements --> deteriorating relations w/ local Indians
    - Armed conflicts began when settlements encroached on Native villages & hunting grounds
  - The Dutch allied w/ the Iroquois to maintain Beverwijck (Albany) for a hub of fur trade
- Labor shortages crippled colonization (patroon sys failed to brign enough people): the colony couldn't get enough workers to satisfy the backers of the colony --> the colony imported slaves in 1626
  - Would make New Amsterdam (NYC) w/ a defensive wall, maintain roads & the port
- The Dutch feared racial mixing --> brought African women --> allowed formation of African Dutch families
  - First African marriage in 1641 & 500+ by 1650
- Dutch slavery was not as exploitative than in later systems: some slaves sued for back wages
  - Some slaves won back a half freedom: could work the land but needed to pay a large tax
- Some objected, but the economic goals outweighed all else

The Portuguese

- Lead in Atlantic nav well before Columbus's voyage
- Restarted Portuguese-Spanish rivalry after seeing the wealth pouring in from New Spain
  - Created a crisis in the Catholic world when they vied fro power; pope intervened & divided the New World w/ the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494; land east of the Tordesillas Meridian would be given to Portugal & all other land would be given to Spain)
- Portuguese turned their attention to the area which would be Brazil in 1530
  - Kicked French traders out & est permanent settlements
  - Built gold & silver mines; but mostly focused on the sugar & slave trade
- Jesuit missionaries brought Christianity to Brazil & strong elements of African & NA spirituality mixed w/ Catholicism
  - Resulted from the demographics of Brazilian slavery (high mortality rates lead to a steady influx of slaves, perpetuating a cultural connection between Brazil & Africa)
- The reliance on slave imports increase the chance of resistance
  - Quilombos: new, free setlments created by ecaped slaves
    - Included African & Native slaves
    - Endured through frequent attacks; several survived throughout the history of Brazilian Slavery

#### English Colonization

- The Protestant Reformation shook England
- When Elizabeth I assumed the English crown in 1558, she oversaw England's "golden age"
  - Expanision of trade & exploration, lit achievements of Shakespeare & Marlowe, English mercantilism, state-assisted manufacturing & trading sys
  - The markets provide lots of consumers & laborers --> stimulated economic expansion & increased English wealth
- Social & econ changes unsettled the English pop
  - Pop ~doubled from 3 mil in 1500 to 5 mil in ~1650
  - Land cost skyrocketted, farming income plummetted, rents & prices rose, wages stagnated
  - Movements to enclose public land (started by landholders changing from agriculture to livestock) evicted tenants & created tons of landless, jobless peasants
    - 1/4 to 1/2 of the pop was in extreme poverty
- New world colonization garnered support in England in a time when the weaalthy were become much richer, there was a tense Spanish rivalry, & an increase in social unrest
  - Justified by econ gains & **doing God's work**
  - Advocates (e.g. Richard Hakluyt & John Dee) used _The History of the Kings of Britains_ (written by 12th cen monk Geoffrey of Monmouth) w/ its mythical account of King Arthurs' conquest & the Christianization of pagen lands
  - Also would glorify God & the queen (who seemed nearly divine, "the Virgin Queen")
- Coarse econ motives: Merchants wanted wealth --> participate in Government sponsored monompolies using joint-stock companies
  - Joint-stock companies: ancestors of corporations, instruments of colonization
- James I approved the formation of the Virginia Company (named after the Virgin Queen)
- First forms of English ventures into the New World were through Prirates (AKA sea dogges)
  - E.g. John Hawkins & Francis Drake
    - Drake was so successful Elizabeth rewarded him w/ knighthood (1580)
  - Plundered Spanish ships & towns
  - Pirates earned a lot for themselves & the crown
- Protestant-Catholic tensions were high
  - The execution of Mary Queen of Scots (a catholic) worsed it
  - In 1588, King Philip II of Spain unleashed the Armada to destroy the British navy & depose Elizabeth
    - The smaller, swifter English ships harassed the armada & forced it to retreat to the Netherlands for reinforcements. Freak storm destroyed the armada; Saving England & securing English Protestantism
- Colonization started haltingly
  - Sir Humpherey Gilbert created a colony in Newfoundland in the late 16th cen but faild
  - In 1587, John White tried settling Roanoke & failed
- King James made peace w/ Spain in 1604 --> piracy no longer was a good option for wealth --> needed to quickly found a colony

### Jamestown

- The Virginia Company (est 1606) hoped to find wealth & planned to find a navigable river w/ a deep arbor away from the Spanish
- 1607: Englishmen settled in Virginia in such a place but it was disastrous
  - Terrible soil & bad water there, but they still built James town
- John Smith took over the colony & navigated Indian diplomacy (Created the Pocahontas story)
  - The Powhatan Confederacy (the people there) initally welcomed them & traded for their metal ax-heads, kettles, tools, & guns
- The English continued to die: there was a "starving time" in the winter of 1609-1610
  - Supplies were lost at sea, relations w/ the indias deteriorated & the colonists fought a slow-burning guerilla war w/ the Powhatan
- Little improved the following years (by 1616, 80 percent of all settlers had died), it was a catastrophe
- The colony was reorganized & the marrage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe (1614) eased tensions 
  - The colony was still limping along
- Tobacco saved Jamestown: the "noxious weed" became fetched high prices in Europe & the tobacco boom began (started in Virginia & later stread to Maryland)
  - Tobacco incentivized further colonization & laid the groundwork for the US
    - Mostly young, male, indentured servants came to Virginia
  - Created the headright policy in 1618 seeing the limiting factor was the number of settlers (granted 50 acres of land to anyone who migrated to the New World)
- Opechancanough replaced his brother, Powhatan, after he died in 1622
  - O promised to drive the colonists away after they started expanding into their land& launched a surpise attack in March
  - Colonists leveraged the attack to kick the Powhatan off their land
- The English felt they were physically, spiritually, & technologically superior to NAs, justifying their conquest
- In the early years of American slavery, race was not yet fixed & slavery not yet codified
  - Early slaves counted as indentured servents (but w/ longer terms & harsher punishments)

### New England

- The New England colonies had loftier goals
  - Migrants expected to profit but they also had religious motives
  - Everyone who moved to New England in the 17th cen was a Puritan, shapping the regions history & governance
- "Puritan" began as an insult; Puritans usually refer to each other as "the godly" if they used any specific term
  - They believed the English church didn't seperate itself enough from Catholicism & largely agree w/ Calvinists (followers of Jean Calvin)
  - The believed humankind was redeemed by God's Grace alone & an individual's importal soul was predestined; those who were selected are the Elect
  - They argued that ornate ceremony, decoration of churches, & corrupt priesthood obscured God's message & reading the Bible is the best way of understanding God
- Puritans were stereotyped as killjoys: they destain excesss & oppose many popular holidays; it's exaggerated, however, since they don't abstain from common things (e.g. alcohol)
- Puritans sought to reform the Church of England (e.g. simpler worship service, abolition of ornate churches) but started the Great Migration (thosans of Puritans traveled to New England from 1630-1640) with the coronation of King Charles I (r. 1625-1649)
- Differed from the Pilgrims (who separated from the Church of England), the Puritans sought to reform the Church but need to move to New England tempararily
- New England colonists usually arrived in family groups, create towns w/ independent landholders
- New England had a broadly shared prosparity characterized with a mixed economy dependent on small farms, shops, fishing, trade with the Old World, etc
  - The land did not support large-scale plantation farming --> slaver never took hold
    - Puritans may not have opposed the system since some Puritans found riches in the Slave trade and in the Caribbean sugar plantations
- The Puritans meet weak Indian tribes --> they had political stability --> The population grew rabidly (from 21k to 91k by 1700)
- Built godly communities: organized land for current & furture use; inhabitants decided on the size of settler's home lot based on wealth & status; allowed male property holders to vote in town meetings, selecting gov officials; wrote town covenants; wayward/divergent individuals were persuaded/corrected/coerced, if it didn't work, they were punished/removed (e.g.they banished the Quakers)
- Puritans didn't create a Godly utopia --> older generations started blaming the younger ones (Jeremiads became a staple in late 17th cen)
- Society grew more diverse & Puritans struggled against pluralism
